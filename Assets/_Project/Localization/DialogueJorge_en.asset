  - m_Id: 102564909056
    m_Localized: 'I''ll get straight to the point: Why did he kill his wife?'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 100671264280576
    m_Localized: (Jorge seemed confused, judging by his eyes. His body didn't move.
      Several seconds passed before he said anything.)
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 100913556639744
    m_Localized: Excuse me? Do you seriously think I would be capable of doing anything
      to my wife? In case you've forgotten, I was the one who called you in the first
      place to investigate this crime. Don't try to play the bad detective with me;
      you're practically working for me.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 101165659475968
    m_Localized: 'You''re right, please excuse my indiscretion. I just wanted to
      do a little exercise with you; there''s no reason to be alarmed. Now, if you''re
      ready, I''ll begin with the first and most anticipated question of all: Where
      were you when you heard the gunshots?'

    m_Localized: (recovering his deep voice)
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 102250272935936
    m_Localized: I was in the garden, smoking like God intended.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 102442682437632
    m_Localized: On the butt or the front?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 102623507271680
    m_Localized: Front.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 103162374672384
    m_Localized: Did he go far from the door when he left, or did he always stay
      on the stone steps?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 104127668572160
    m_Localized: I walked a few steps toward the roundabout to look at the flowers;
      I was planning to bring one to my wife later. But what does it matter if I
      was far from the door or not, detective? It's not a crime to move your legs,
      is it?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 104769267060736
    m_Localized: A hint of an amused smile flickered across his face, only to be
      erased in a fraction of a second.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 105651295637504
    m_Localized: I'm just trying to set the stage.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 105743368998912
    m_Localized: I noticed the road is unpaved; didn't you consider paving it?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 106095308853248
    m_Localized: I'd love to have that power, sir, but the house belongs to my brother.
      Why are you even talking to me about this?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 106493000175616
    m_Localized: I hate driving a new car on dirt roads, it was just a comment.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 107017569193984
    m_Localized: (Jorge glared at him. He took it as an insult to his very being.)
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 107395576647680
    m_Localized: Did he used to give his wife flowers?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 107632106033152
    m_Localized: Many years ago, in the early years of our relationship, yes. Later,
      one could say that that gesture lost some of its value.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 108997570088960
    m_Localized: So why re-evaluate that gesture?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 109366090027008
    m_Localized: Because she had been feeling unwell since dinner, I thought a flower
      might make her feel better.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110011756990464
    m_Localized: So he considered himself a caring husband?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110273494142976
    m_Localized: I never said no, it's just that flowers didn't mean the same thing
      to me anymore. But for the occasion, and after so many years, I thought they
      wouldn't be out of place. You know, preserving a marriage isn't easy, detective,
      if you know what I'm talking about.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110918125113344
    m_Localized: (He gives her an amused look, seeking complicity; he is completely
      ignored)
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 111047313870848
    m_Localized: He said his wife had been feeling unwell since dinner. Would you
      like to tell me what happened since then?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 111179790962688
    m_Localized: Of course. It seems the food hadn't agreed with her, mainly stomach
      cramps. She endured the pain as long as she could, even joining us for a glass
      of champagne at midnight.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 111615340072960
    m_Localized: However, that drink finally got to her. Excuse me, she left the
      table and went upstairs to the bathroom. After an hour without her returning,
      I did what any husband would do and went upstairs to check on her. I hadn't
      even opened the door when she stopped me.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 112550497898496
    m_Localized: 'I could hear water running. I asked her if she was alright, to
      which she replied verbatim: "Yes, honey."'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 112803389263872
    m_Localized: Faced with that response, I decided to go back downstairs and go
      out for a smoke to calm things down, but as soon as I got downstairs I went
      straight to the front door, without going through the dining room where my
      brother and cousin were supposedly still drinking.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 113319330598912
    m_Localized: Then he heard the gunshots and went upstairs immediately to find
      his wife dead.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 113464017309696
    m_Localized: Exactly.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 113659002114048
    m_Localized: (The detective noticed that on the bedside table in the guest room
      there was an open medicine cabinet, probably taken from the bathroom if that
      family organized things with general logic.)
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 113768326647808
    m_Localized: Is he injured?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 145308704198656
    m_Localized: (Noticing the same thing as the detective)
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 173375101620224
    m_Localized: A tall cat, dressed in a silk jacket and trousers the color of coffee.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 175325348122624
    m_Localized: Always standing upright with his arms behind him, he never let go
      of his hands, or rather his paws.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 175334890164224
    m_Localized: We cannot see his face under his mask, but we will always see his
      eyes, where they go when he speaks, what they hide.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 175344209907712
    m_Localized: In fact, that will be the case with every guest we question, and
      why not, if we're at a costume party.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 175354074910720
    m_Localized: This same feline was Juanita's husband.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 175361528188928
    m_Localized: They arrived at the party around 9:00 with their arms intertwined,
      like an unbreakable chain.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 175370894069760
    m_Localized: Juanita wasn't wearing a mask, but a domino mask.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 175379538530304
    m_Localized: People saw her smiling broadly during the party, a delicate but
      genuine smile.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 175385544773632
    m_Localized: The couple greeted the other two guests very cordially, Juanita
      even more warmly by discreetly extending a hand to each of them.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 175391643291648
    m_Localized: Jorge was a straightforward character, but not necessarily cold.
      He liked to maintain a certain distance from people, not out of dislike, but
      because he considered it a sign of respect, as someone who deserved special
      treatment over the rest.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 175404477861888
    m_Localized: He had that look, that commanding presence that would make anyone
      kneel.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 175409682993152
    m_Localized: Anyone would think that his loved ones were afraid of him, maybe
      so, maybe they hid it well, out of fear.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 175414531608576
    m_Localized: But it should be noted that he was charismatic, eloquent, and calm.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 175419132760064
    m_Localized: A skilled smoker, he needed to leave the common room every hour
      to refresh his head in the front garden and intoxicate his lungs with the smoke
      of his tobacco.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 175423423533056
    m_Localized: His mustaches, once brown like his clothes, were beginning to turn
      yellow.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 175429152952320
    m_Localized: Detective Otto looks for him first for obvious reasons.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 175747123138560
    m_Localized: He begins to speak to him at a prudent distance, of course suggested
      by the person being questioned who kept crossing his arms behind his back.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 264056822321152
    m_Localized: Of course, while looking at the flowers I cut myself on the thorns
      on the stems. Right now I'm applying pressure to stop the bleeding.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 264064120410112
    m_Localized: (Tries to laugh awkwardly, without success)
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 264072550961152
    m_Localized: That's all, please wait in this room.

    m_Localized: You can count on that agent.
