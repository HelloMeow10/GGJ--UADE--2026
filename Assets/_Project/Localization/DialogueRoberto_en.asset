    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 204922919866368
    m_Localized: I couldn't get into the bathroom. When I saw her, my knees just
      buckled. I threw up, that's why I needed the glass of water.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 204927957225472

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 205276814266368
    m_Localized: I'm asking about your relationship with her. You must understand
      that I need to find a motive for the murder of a cat so beloved by your family.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 205298637230080

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: Diego was very attractive; no one blamed him for natural bodily
      reactions.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 205334834073600
    m_Localized: How dare he?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 205342677422080
    m_Localized: To what? To insinuate that you felt something more for your brother's

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 205526505377792
    m_Localized: Are those emotions tormenting him? Is that feeling of being ignored
      terrifying him? I understand that not only was he ignored by his brother, but
      also by the woman of his dreams. It's curious that they ended up together.

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 205548559028224
    m_Localized: I bet you've dreamt a thousand times about the day you open that
      bathroom door and find your brother dead. Or did things actually turn out the
      way you always wanted? Did you come to hate her for not loving him?

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 206087145410560
    m_Localized: Jealousy everywhere, a pregnancy the victim didn't want, a husband
      who goes from cold to attentive in a second, a cousin who answers too many
      times with the words "I don't know" to every question I ask him about the one
      who was supposed to be his best friend, and now a brother who was always in
      love with his sister-in-law.

    m_Localized: 'It was Roberto''s turn to be questioned, Jorge''s brother, Juan''s
      cousin, Juanita''s secret admirer. When Otto entered the kitchen, he understood
      perfectly what he was facing: a stone statue that wouldn''t say anything, at
      least nothing useful. Serene face, piercing eyes.'

      of truth, sat an empty shoebox.'
