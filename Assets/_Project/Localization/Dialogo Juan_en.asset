    m_Localized: This particular feline was none other than Jorge's cousin.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 162790892916736
    m_Localized: "They were those cousins \u200B\u200Bwho, from the moment their
      mothers introduced them, were never separated again."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 162801282207744
    m_Localized: And it was until tonight that they continued to look for excuses
      to get together as a family and share the stories they had built since the
      last time they saw each other.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 162810278989824
    m_Localized: Of course, their relationship was never perfect; as with all cousins,
      competitiveness and jealousy were always present.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 162817770016768
    m_Localized: As puppies, disputes might be expressed by seeing who was faster
      or who could climb the highest trees; as teenagers, who could hunt the most
      birds.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 163226332975104
    m_Localized: And as adults, who arrived at dinner with a better car or a better
      wife; and Juan had recently lost his.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 163234264403968
    m_Localized: It had been since evil took her away, but he remained dormant, as
      if his true self were hidden deep within his subconscious.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 163245157011456
    m_Localized: It was just an empty vessel, one that no longer told the anecdotes
      of the past or made the same old jokes every year.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 163252639649792
    m_Localized: His gray goatee was still like that, his green eyes too, but Juan,
      even if he tried as he did during that dinner, was gone.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 163260902428672
    m_Localized: Otto sits at the other end of the dining room table to question
      Juan, who may be subdued but is still imposing.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 163389915025408
    m_Localized: The cupboards with the vases and plates seem to loom dangerously
      over their heads, the wallpaper seems to be melting in sections,
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 163397552852992
    m_Localized: The chandelier hanging above their heads exhales its last remaining
      flickers of light. The detective understands that the atmosphere has changed.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 163401701019648
    m_Localized: Something big is being hidden this time.

    m_Localized: How does he get along with his cousin?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169055106912256
    m_Localized: Well, we've been friends since we were puppies. We've never had
      any serious arguments or fights that required time to heal. Of course, there
      have been disagreements, like in any family, but I'd say we have a good relationship.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169055715086336
    m_Localized: You seem distracted, sir, or perhaps your relationship with your
      cousin wasn't the wonderful one you expected, considering you're just getting
      together for a meal and a drink on a random evening. I have to admit, I'm surprised
      you're so willing to see your cousin among such a small group of people who
      could have eased any tension between you.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169056230985728
    m_Localized: "I personally would need a crowd to see someone I clearly don't
      want to be with. But if you planned something special for tonight, it would
      make sense\u2026"
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169057287950336
    m_Localized: AM I TO BLAME FOR JUANITA'S DEATH? AM I SO HEARTLESS AS TO HURT
      SOMEONE?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169057766100992
    m_Localized: I'm just exploring possibilities, Juan. My job is to solve this
      crime, and I started with a blank sheet of paper. If you're on my team, you'll
      understand.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169058168754176
    m_Localized: "I understand, but you can't expect me to be in a good mood, Detective.
      Please excuse me if I don't greet you with a smile, but my cousin's wife was
      found brutally murdered\u2014the wife of MY cousin, who was always a friend
      to me, more than that..."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169058571407360
    m_Localized: "A brother. Forgive me if after my wife's death I can no longer
      be the same as before, and believe me, I hate how my cousins \u200B\u200Bsee
      me now, how they see that I'm not the same as before, but even in this condition
      I would be incapable of hurting a fly."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169058978254848
    m_Localized: I regret my accusations. I was completely unaware of your past.
      Tell me how long ago your wife died.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169059401879552
    m_Localized: He died from a tumor in his head,\n<i>(Juan pauses for a moment,
      hesitates)</i>\n18 months have passed.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169059804532736
    m_Localized: "Since then, it's been hard to get by, but my cousins \u200B\u200Band
      Juanita mean everything to me. They're the only family I have left, and thanks
      to them, I keep trying. And believe me, tonight wasn't just any night."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169060249128960
    m_Localized: What did you say?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169138196074496
    m_Localized: You said at the beginning that this was just an ordinary night where
      we got together to eat and toast.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169144462364672
    m_Localized: But the truth is that tonight, Juanita gave us the news of her pregnancy.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169149273231360
    m_Localized: Was she pregnant?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169154302201856
    m_Localized: First month or less, I imagine.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169160245530624
    m_Localized: But what I really wonder is why Jorge didn't tell me what would
      have been magnificent news hours ago.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169166646038528
    m_Localized: "I'm not surprised\u2026"
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169173260455936
    m_Localized: Doesn't it surprise you that the man who would have been the father
      ignored the fact that his wife was pregnant when he told me about the situation?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169597761769472
    m_Localized: Look, I don't know the details. Juanita hasn't told me things in
      a while, not like she used to. Don't get me wrong, we've always been best friends,
      and she'll always be my lifeline, but these last few months I've noticed she's
      been more reserved.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169618506797056
    m_Localized: Were you, your cousin's wife, and best friends?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169622420082688
    m_Localized: Yes, since elementary school. Jorge met her thanks to me.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169627310641152
    m_Localized: When she lashed out at me, you called her "my cousin's wife." Why
      not call her your best friend?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169632368971776
    m_Localized: Because nothing in my head works the way it should since what I
      told you. Sometimes I say or do things that I wouldn't have said or done at
      any other time.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169639507677184
    m_Localized: And tell me, why do you think parents try to avoid this topic of
      pregnancy?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169644993826816
    m_Localized: I insist, I don't know the details, but I'm not so sure Juanita
      wanted it. I mean, whenever we've talked about the possibility of becoming
      parents someday, she's vehemently rejected the idea.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169660642775040
    m_Localized: She simply didn't want to. That may be the reason for her silence
      and distance; perhaps she needed a moment to consider how she would continue
      her life.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169667152334848
    m_Localized: And why didn't Jorge tell me anything?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169673376681984
    m_Localized: I don't know, I honestly don't know. I never discussed that idea
      with him. I don't know what he was thinking.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169681375219712
    m_Localized: Weren't they like brothers?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169686139949056
    m_Localized: We simply never talked about it. I never thought about having children
      either; we were never at that point in our lives.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169691147948032
    m_Localized: Don't you think there might be something more?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169695816208384
    m_Localized: What do you think?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169700237004800
    m_Localized: What if he did want to have it? Do you think there could have been
      arguments about that?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169705240809472
    m_Localized: Maybe, but he had it after all. Were they on the same page or not?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169710882148352
    m_Localized: Is she so innocent as to believe there's always consent? Or does
      she know something and just won't tell me?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169721959305216
    m_Localized: I'm not innocent, and I don't intend to hide anything from her;
      I've only told her the truth. But what she's implying about my cousin and my
      deceased best friend is something I can't tolerate right now.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169729311920128
    m_Localized: (Juan's spark seemed to reignite for a second. The detective didn't
      know him, but somehow he knew that this was the real Juan.)
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 169735511101440
    m_Localized: I don't intend to bother you any longer with pointless accusations,
      sir. Just tell me where you were when you heard the gunshots.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 170180447064064
    m_Localized: I stayed in the dining room the entire time from the moment dinner
      started.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 170186738520064
    m_Localized: Was he with someone at the time of the crime?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 170202756567040
    m_Localized: "\rNo."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 170208444043264
    m_Localized: Where were Jorge and Roberto?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 170213196189696
    m_Localized: Jorge had gone upstairs to check on Juanita; I assume the footsteps
      on the stairs and the sound of the front door I heard later were his. Roberto
      got up from the table afterward, saying he was going upstairs to charge his
      phone.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 170305038864384
    m_Localized: I remember it turning off at some point, so that might be true.
      But the truth is, when I was alone, I decided to put on some music on my headphones
      to pass the time.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 170311644893184
    m_Localized: "I didn't hear footsteps upstairs again, nor arguments, nor shouts.
      The only noise loud enough to jolt me \u200B\u200Bout of my daze was the first
      gunshot."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 170317655330816
    m_Localized: Thank you Juan, please remain in this room until this is all over.

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 170343798427648
    m_Localized: Be careful with Roberto, I must tell you that he was always a very
      jealous boy of Jorge.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 170488162177024
    m_Localized: Why do you say that?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 170519585902592
    m_Localized: Because his only love since elementary school was always Juanita.
